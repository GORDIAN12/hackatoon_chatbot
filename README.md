# Problem

Celebrities have limited time to generate personalized, personified responses. How to generate greater closeness with users and celebrities: artist, musician, actor, influencer, etc.

# Solution

Create a chatbot that contains the artist's database as well as common responses, which generates the feeling that you are talking to the celebrity.

# Description
This chatbot is capable of answering questions that users ask, simulating a conversation to get closer to their favorite celebrities. This bot is capable of responding in text and audio formats. We convert the audio to text so that the program can receive tokens and generate an answer to the question. Below are some examples of conversations that occurred in the demo presentation.
